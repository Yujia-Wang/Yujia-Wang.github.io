When comparing online clothes shopping and physical store shopping, 30.8% prefer shopping online, 15.4% prefer physical stores, and 53.8% have no preference between the two. People said they like the experience of physical stores, however, the physical store shopping experience can be very exhausting. When asked whether they would ask for assistance when shopping in stores, 46.2% respondents said they prefer not asking for any help.</p>

In addition, many high-tech companies have explored the concept of virtual fitting rooms as a potential solution. The customer can see themselves on the screen with a 3D copy of clothes.</p>

Next, we combined similar ideas, and also combined different ideas into one to tackle multiple problem spaces.</p>

                            <p>After we finished paper sketch and storyboards for our three design concepts, we launched a survey and interviewed experts to gather user feedback. Through this way, we got many valuable insights and reconsidered how we could better design our final solution. After group discussion, we made some changes about our design concepts, combining parts of them. Eventually, we had our final version of design concept.</p>

                                <li><span style="color:#f9eb9e;">Use dynamic images (e.g., GIF) as the measurement instruction images instead of static images</span>, this way is more clear to users.</li>

                        <p>This is the first project that I worked from the very beginning to the end. I learned a lot about evidence-based design process. Being proactive in every step gives me a strong foundation for future design work.</p>
                        <p>Another thing that impressed me a lot when working for this project is how important accessible design or universal design is for people with impairments. One of my participants said: <span style="color:#f9eb9e;">"You probably never think about what technology means to disabled people. For you, it is just an alternative option, but for us, it helps us to survive in this world."</span> I believe our work has important impact on people, and we will keep working on it. I really hope more and more people can put their attention to special groups, because they are also a part of this world.</p>
