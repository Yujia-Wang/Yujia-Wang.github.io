                            <p>During this session, we came up with plenty of ideas around our three problem spaces. Then we coded and categorized these ideas based on their type, such as body scanning, virtual assistants, tactile displays, mechanical solutions, etc. We were able to see more patterns emerging once we structured the data. Next, we combined similar ideas, and compared each idea's feasibility. Finally, we narrowed down to three design concepts.</p>

                            <p>After we finished paper sketch and storyboards for our three design concepts, we launched a survey and interviewed experts to gather user feedback. Through this way, we got many valuable insights and reconsidered how we could better design our final solution. After group discussion, we made some changes about our design concepts, combining parts of them. Eventually, we had our final version of design concept.</p>

                        <p>This is the first project that I was involved from the very beginning to the end. I learned a lot about evidence-based design process. Being proactive in every step gives me a strong foundation for future design work.</p>
                        <p>Another thing that impressed me when working for this project is how important accessible design or universal design is for people with impairments. One of my participants said:</p>
                        <p class="fittingeasy-quote">"You probably never think about what technology means to disabled people. For you, it is just an alternative option, but for us, it helps us to survive in this world."</p>
                        <p>I believe our work has important impact on people, and we will keep working on it. I really hope more and more people can put their focus on people who have special needs, because they are also a part of this world.</p>
